// MARK: - EClass

/// A class in the Ecore metamodel.
///
/// `EClass` represents a class definition in the metamodel, similar to a class declaration
/// in object-oriented programming languages. It defines the structure and behaviour of
/// model objects through:
///
/// - **Structural Features**: Attributes and references that define the class's properties
/// - **Operations**: Methods that can be invoked on instances
/// - **Inheritance**: Supertypes that this class extends
/// - **Metadata**: Whether the class is abstract or represents an interface
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let person = EClass(
///     name: "Person",
///     isAbstract: false,
///     structuralFeatures: [
///         // Features would be added here
///     ]
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Inheritance
///
/// Classes can extend multiple supertypes through the ``eSuperTypes`` property.
/// The ``allSuperTypes`` computed property provides the complete inheritance hierarchy
/// including transitive supertypes.
///
/// ## Feature Access
///
/// Structural features can be accessed by name using ``getStructuralFeature(name:)``
/// or filtered by type using ``allAttributes`` and ``allReferences``.
